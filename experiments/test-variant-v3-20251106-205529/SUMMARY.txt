# v3 Test Results Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Variant:** v3 (POP-ALL v3)
**Success Rate:** 15/20 (75%)

## Results

✅ **Passed (15):** 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
❌ **Failed (5):** 1, 4, 8, 11, 19

## Failure Analysis

**Transpile Errors (3):**
- Program 01: "Atom at top-level" - wrote explanation text before code
- Program 04: "POP-ALL with empty stack" - POP-ALL usage error
- Program 19: "POP with empty stack" - too many POPs

**Execution Errors (2):**
- Program 08: Destructuring syntax error (generated invalid Clojure)
- Program 11: core.async "Can only recur from tail position" (logic error)

## Comparison to Historical Data

From EXPERIMENT-RESULTS.md:
- v3 previous: 12/20 (60%)
- v3 today: 15/20 (75%)

**Difference:** +3 programs (15% improvement)

Possible reasons for variance:
- Different LLM version/state
- Single iteration (historical used parallel comprehensive test)
- Random variation in fresh instances

## Key Takeaway

v3 achieves 75%, which is:
- Better than historical 60%
- Worse than v1 (80%)
- Same as v2 POP-ALL (75%)
- Better than v4 (0%!)

v1 (explicit POP counting) remains the winner at 80%.

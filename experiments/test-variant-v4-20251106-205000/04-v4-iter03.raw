I need to write Program 4 in CLJ-PP format. Let me analyze the required structure:

1. Namespace declaration
2. Vector of user maps
3. `active-users` function (filter age > 18)
4. `user-names` function (extract names)

Key points:
- Must expand `#()` anonymous functions to full `fn` form
- Count each PUSH- and emit exactly that many POPs
- No explanatory text, start immediately with code

```clojure
PUSH-( ns examples.program4 POP

PUSH-( def users
  PUSH-[
    PUSH-{ :name "Alice" :age 25 :role "admin" POP
    PUSH-{ :name "Bob" :age 17 :role "user" POP
    PUSH-{ :name "Charlie" :age 30 :role "moderator" POP
    PUSH-{ :name "Diana" :age 16 :role "user" POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn active-users PUSH-[ users POP
  PUSH-( filter PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ user POP
    PUSH-( > PUSH-( :age user POP 18 POP
  POP POP users POP
POP

PUSH-( defn user-names PUSH-[ users POP
  PUSH-( map PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ user POP
    PUSH-( :name user POP
  POP POP users POP
POP
```

I need permission to create the test3.cljp file. Let me explain what I've written:

**Structure:**
1. **Namespace declaration** - Uses POP-ALL since it's a complete top-level form
2. **Factorial function:**
   - Uses `cond` with two cases: base case (n <= 1) returns 1, else case does recursion
   - The `:else` clause uses POP-ALL at the end because it's the last line of the entire function
   - This closes: the `-` call, the `factorial` call, the `*` call, the `cond`, and the `defn`

3. **Fibonacci function:**
   - Uses `cond` with three cases: n=0 returns 0, n=1 returns 1, else case does recursion
   - The `:else` clause opens a `+` with two recursive calls
   - First recursive call uses `POP POP` (closes `-`, then closes `fibonacci`)
   - Second recursive call uses POP-ALL to close everything remaining

**Key pattern:** Each function's last expression uses POP-ALL, which closes all open containers in that entire top-level form. No trailing POPs needed!

Once you approve, I'll create the file and we can test it with the cljpp compiler.

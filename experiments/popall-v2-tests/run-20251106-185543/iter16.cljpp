I've written the factorial and fibonacci functions in CLJ-PP format. Let me verify the structure:

**factorial function:**
- Line 3: Opens defn, opens vector for parameter, closes vector with POP
- Line 4: Opens cond
- Line 5: First clause - opens condition `(<= n 1)`, closes with POP, then returns 1
- Line 6: Else clause - opens `*`, opens `factorial` call, opens `-` call, then POP-ALL closes everything (-, factorial, *, cond, and defn)

**fibonacci function:**
- Line 8: Opens defn, opens vector for parameter, closes vector with POP
- Line 9: Opens cond
- Line 10: First clause - `(= n 0)` returns 0
- Line 11: Second clause - `(= n 1)` returns 1
- Lines 12-14: Else clause - opens `+` call with two fibonacci recursive calls, the second one uses POP-ALL to close everything

Both functions use POP-ALL on their last lines to close all remaining containers at once, following the pattern from Examples 6 and 7 in the guide.

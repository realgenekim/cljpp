I need your permission to create the file `test3.cljp` with the factorial and fibonacci functions in CLJ-PP format.

Once approved, the code will include:

**factorial function:**
- Uses `cond` with base case `(<= n 1)` returning 1
- Recursive case: `(* n (factorial (- n 1)))`
- Uses `POP-ALL` on the last line to close all containers

**fibonacci function:**
- Uses `cond` with two base cases: `(= n 0)` returning 0, `(= n 1)` returning 1
- Recursive case: `(+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))`
- First recursive call uses explicit `POP POP` to close inner forms
- Second recursive call uses `POP-ALL` to close everything

Both functions follow the pattern from the guide where `POP-ALL` is used on the final line to close all remaining containers.

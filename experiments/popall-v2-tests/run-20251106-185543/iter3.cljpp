I need permission to create the file. Let me explain what I'm writing:

**factorial function:**
- Opens `cond`
- First condition: `(<= n 1)` returns `1`
- `:else` clause: `(* n (factorial (- n 1)))` with `POP-ALL` to close everything at the end

**fibonacci function:**
- Opens `cond`
- First condition: `(= n 0)` returns `0`
- Second condition: `(= n 1)` returns `1`
- `:else` clause: `(+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))` with `POP-ALL` at the very end

Both functions use `POP-ALL` on their final line to close all remaining containers (the nested calls, the cond, and the defn).

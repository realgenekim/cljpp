I need permission to write the CLJ-PP file. Let me explain what the code will do:

**Namespace declaration:**
- `PUSH-( ns examples.test3 POP-ALL` - Creates the namespace and closes immediately

**Factorial function:**
- Uses `cond` with two cases: base case (`<= n 1` returns `1`) and recursive case (`:else`)
- The `:else` clause opens three nested calls: `*`, `factorial`, and `-`
- Uses `POP-ALL` at the end to close all containers (the `-`, `factorial`, `*`, `cond`, and `defn`)

**Fibonacci function:**
- Uses `cond` with three cases: `n=0` returns `0`, `n=1` returns `1`, and recursive case
- The `:else` clause opens `+` with two recursive calls
- First recursive call uses `POP POP` to close the `-` and `fibonacci` calls
- Second recursive call uses `POP-ALL` to close everything (the `-`, second `fibonacci`, the `+`, `cond`, and `defn`)

Both functions follow the pattern where **POP-ALL is used on the absolute last line** to close all remaining containers, with no trailing POPs afterward.

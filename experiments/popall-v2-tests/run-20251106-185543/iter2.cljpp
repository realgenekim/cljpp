I need permission to write the test3.cljp file. This file will contain:

1. **factorial function**: Uses cond with base case (n <= 1 returns 1) and recursive case using POP-ALL to close all containers at the end
2. **fibonacci function**: Uses cond with two base cases (n=0 returns 0, n=1 returns 1) and recursive case that adds two recursive calls, using POP-ALL on the final line

Both functions follow the CLJ-PP guide's patterns:
- Explicit POPs for intermediate closures (like the vector parameters and inner base cases)
- POP-ALL on the last line of each function to close everything remaining (the arithmetic operations, cond, and defn)

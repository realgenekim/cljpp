I need permission to write the file. The CLJ-PP code I've written follows the patterns from the guide:

**Factorial function:**
- Opens defn, then parameter vector (with POP to close it)
- Opens cond with two cases:
  - Base case: `(<= n 1)` returns 1
  - Recursive case: Uses POP-ALL on the last line to close everything (the `-` call, the `factorial` call, the `*` call, the `cond`, and the `defn`)

**Fibonacci function:**
- Opens defn, then parameter vector (with POP)
- Opens cond with three cases:
  - `(= n 0)` returns 0
  - `(= n 1)` returns 1
  - Recursive case: Opens `+` and adds two recursive calls
    - First call: `fibonacci(n-1)` with explicit POPs to close `-` then `fibonacci`
    - Second call: `fibonacci(n-2)` with POP-ALL to close everything (the second `-`, the second `fibonacci`, the `+`, the `cond`, and the `defn`)

Both functions use POP-ALL on their final lines since they're completely done, with no trailing POPs needed.

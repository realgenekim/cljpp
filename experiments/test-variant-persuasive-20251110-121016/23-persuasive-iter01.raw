I'll write this tree traversal program using CLJ-PP format.

```clojure
PUSH-( ns examples.program23 POP

PUSH-( defn tree-map PUSH-[ f tree POP
  PUSH-( when tree
    PUSH-{ :value PUSH-( f PUSH-( :value tree POP POP
           :left PUSH-( tree-map f PUSH-( :left tree POP POP
           :right PUSH-( tree-map f PUSH-( :right tree POP POP
    POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn tree-reduce PUSH-[ f acc tree POP
  PUSH-( if tree
    PUSH-( let PUSH-[
      acc1 PUSH-( f acc PUSH-( :value tree POP POP
      acc2 PUSH-( tree-reduce f acc1 PUSH-( :left tree POP POP
    POP
      PUSH-( tree-reduce f acc2 PUSH-( :right tree POP POP
    POP
    acc
  POP
POP
```

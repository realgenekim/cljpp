I'll write this program using CLJ-PP format for precise delimiter management.

PUSH-( ns examples.program13
  PUSH-( :require PUSH-[ clojure.spec.alpha :as s POP POP
POP

PUSH-( s/def ::name string? POP

PUSH-( s/def ::age PUSH-( s/and int? PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ x POP PUSH-( pos? x POP POP POP POP

PUSH-( s/def ::email PUSH-( s/and string? #(re-matches #".+@.+\..+" %) POP POP

PUSH-( s/def ::user
  PUSH-( s/keys :req-un PUSH-[ ::name ::age ::email POP POP
POP

PUSH-( defn validate-user PUSH-[ user POP
  PUSH-( s/valid? ::user user POP
POP

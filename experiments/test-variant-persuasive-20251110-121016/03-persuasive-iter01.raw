I'll write the factorial and fibonacci functions using CLJ-PP format with recursion and cond.

```clojure
PUSH-( ns examples.program3 POP

PUSH-( defn factorial PUSH-[ n POP
  PUSH-( cond
    PUSH-( <= n 1 POP 1
    :else PUSH-( * n PUSH-( factorial PUSH-( - n 1 POP POP POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn fibonacci PUSH-[ n POP
  PUSH-( cond
    PUSH-( <= n 0 POP 0
    PUSH-( = n 1 POP 1
    :else PUSH-( + PUSH-( fibonacci PUSH-( - n 1 POP POP PUSH-( fibonacci PUSH-( - n 2 POP POP POP
  POP
POP
```

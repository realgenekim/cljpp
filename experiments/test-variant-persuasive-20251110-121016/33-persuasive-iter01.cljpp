I'll write this event sourcing program using CLJ-PP format.

PUSH-( ns examples.program33 POP

PUSH-( defmulti apply-event
  PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ state event POP PUSH-( :type event POP POP
POP

PUSH-( defmethod apply-event :user-created
  PUSH-[ state event POP
  PUSH-( assoc state
    :id PUSH-( :user-id event POP
    :name PUSH-( :name event POP
    :email PUSH-( :email event POP
    :created-at PUSH-( :timestamp event POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defmethod apply-event :email-changed
  PUSH-[ state event POP
  PUSH-( assoc state
    :email PUSH-( :new-email event POP
    :updated-at PUSH-( :timestamp event POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defmethod apply-event :name-changed
  PUSH-[ state event POP
  PUSH-( assoc state
    :name PUSH-( :new-name event POP
    :updated-at PUSH-( :timestamp event POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defmethod apply-event :user-deleted
  PUSH-[ state event POP
  PUSH-( assoc state
    :deleted true
    :deleted-at PUSH-( :timestamp event POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn aggregate

  PUSH-( reduce apply-event PUSH-{ POP events POP
POP

PUSH-( defn get-state-at-time
  PUSH-[ events timestamp POP
  PUSH-( ->> events
    PUSH-( filter PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ e POP PUSH-( <= PUSH-( :timestamp e POP timestamp POP POP POP
    PUSH-( aggregate POP

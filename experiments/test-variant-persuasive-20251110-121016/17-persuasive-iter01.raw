I'll write Program 17 using CLJ-PP format:

```clojure
PUSH-( ns examples.program17 POP

PUSH-( defn lazy-range PUSH-[ start end POP
  PUSH-( letfn PUSH-[
    PUSH-( PUSH-[ step PUSH-[ n POP
      PUSH-( when PUSH-( < n end POP
        PUSH-( lazy-seq
          PUSH-( cons n PUSH-( step PUSH-( inc n POP POP POP
        POP
      POP
    POP POP
  POP
    PUSH-( step start POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn lazy-fibonacci
  PUSH-( PUSH-[ POP
    PUSH-( lazy-fibonacci 0 1 POP
  POP
  PUSH-( PUSH-[ a b POP
    PUSH-( lazy-seq
      PUSH-( cons a PUSH-( lazy-fibonacci b PUSH-( + a b POP POP POP
    POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn take-while-sum PUSH-[ pred coll POP
  PUSH-( letfn PUSH-[
    PUSH-( PUSH-[ step PUSH-[ s xs POP
      PUSH-( when-let PUSH-[ PUSH-[ x PUSH-( first xs POP POP POP
        PUSH-( let PUSH-[ new-sum PUSH-( + s x POP POP
          PUSH-( when PUSH-( pred new-sum POP
            PUSH-( lazy-seq
              PUSH-( cons x PUSH-( step new-sum PUSH-( rest xs POP POP POP
            POP
          POP
        POP
      POP
    POP POP
  POP
    PUSH-( step 0 coll POP
  POP
POP
```

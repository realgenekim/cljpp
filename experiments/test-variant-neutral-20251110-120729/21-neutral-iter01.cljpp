I'll write this program in CLJ-PP format.

PUSH-( ns examples.program21
  PUSH-( :require PUSH-[ clojure.string :as str POP POP
POP

PUSH-( defn split-words PUSH-[ s POP
  PUSH-( str/split s PUSH-( re-pattern " " POP POP
POP

PUSH-( defn reverse-words PUSH-[ s POP
  PUSH-( ->> PUSH-( split-words s POP
    PUSH-( map PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ word POP PUSH-( str/reverse word POP POP POP
    PUSH-( str/join " " POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn title-case PUSH-[ s POP
  PUSH-( ->> PUSH-( split-words s POP
    PUSH-( map PUSH-( fn PUSH-[ word POP
      PUSH-( str PUSH-( str/upper-case PUSH-( subs word 0 1 POP POP
        PUSH-( subs word 1 POP
      POP
    POP POP
    PUSH-( str/join " " POP
  POP
POP

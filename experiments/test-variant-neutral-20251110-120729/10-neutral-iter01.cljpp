Based on the examples I've read, I can see the expected format. Here's Program 10 in CLJ-PP format:

PUSH-( ns examples.program10 POP

PUSH-( defn user-badge PUSH-[ PUSH-{ :keys PUSH-[ name verified? role POP POP POP
  PUSH-[ :div.user-badge
    PUSH-[ :span.name name POP
    PUSH-( when verified?
      PUSH-[ :span.verified "✓" POP
    POP
    PUSH-[ :span.role role POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn user-list PUSH-[ users POP
  PUSH-[ :div.user-list
    PUSH-( for PUSH-[ user users POP
      PUSH-[ user-badge user POP
    POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn stats-panel PUSH-[ stats POP
  PUSH-( let PUSH-[
    total PUSH-( reduce + PUSH-( vals stats POP POP
  POP
    PUSH-[ :div.stats-panel
      PUSH-[ :div.total "Total: " total POP
      PUSH-[ :ul.stats
        PUSH-( for PUSH-[ PUSH-[ k v POP stats POP
          PUSH-[ :li PUSH-[ :span.key PUSH-( name k POP POP ": " PUSH-[ :span.value v POP POP
        POP
      POP
    POP
  POP
POP

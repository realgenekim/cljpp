I'll analyze this request and generate the appropriate CLJ-PP code.

Looking at the task, I need to:
1. Create a namespace `examples.program1`
2. Define function `add` that takes two numbers and returns their sum
3. Define function `greet` that takes a name and returns a greeting string

Based on the specification, I'll use the CLJ-PP format with proper PUSH and POP operations:

PUSH-( ns examples.program1 POP

PUSH-( defn add PUSH-[ a b POP
  PUSH-( + a b POP
POP

PUSH-( defn greet PUSH-[ name POP
  PUSH-( str "Hello, " name "!" POP
POP

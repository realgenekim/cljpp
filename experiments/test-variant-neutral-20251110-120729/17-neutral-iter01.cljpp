I need permission to create the test file. Here's the CLJ-PP code for Program 17:

PUSH-( ns examples.program17 POP

PUSH-( defn lazy-range PUSH-[ start end POP
  PUSH-( letfn PUSH-[
    PUSH-( step PUSH-[ n POP
      PUSH-( when PUSH-( < n end POP
        PUSH-( lazy-seq
          PUSH-( cons n PUSH-( step PUSH-( inc n POP POP POP
        POP
      POP
    POP
  POP
    PUSH-( step start POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn lazy-fibonacci
  PUSH-( PUSH-[ POP PUSH-( lazy-fibonacci 0 1 POP POP
  PUSH-( PUSH-[ a b POP
    PUSH-( lazy-seq
      PUSH-( cons a PUSH-( lazy-fibonacci b PUSH-( + a b POP POP POP
    POP
  POP
POP

PUSH-( defn take-while-sum PUSH-[ pred coll POP
  PUSH-( lazy-seq
    PUSH-( when-let PUSH-[ PUSH-[ s PUSH-( seq coll POP POP POP
      PUSH-( let PUSH-[ f PUSH-( first s POP POP
        PUSH-( when PUSH-( pred f POP
          PUSH-( cons f PUSH-( take-while-sum pred PUSH-( rest s POP POP POP
        POP
      POP
    POP
  POP
POP

This implements:
- `lazy-range` using `letfn` with a recursive `step` function
- `lazy-fibonacci` with multi-arity (0-arity calls 2-arity with 0,1)
- `take-while-sum` using `lazy-seq` with `when-let` and `when`
